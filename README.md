This code is a straightforward exercise that demonstrates how to add two numbers in Python.

Setting Up: It starts by creating two variables, num1 and num2, and assigns them the values 8 and 10, respectively. These are the numbers we want to add together.

Calculating the Sum: Next, it calculates the sum of these two numbers and stores the result in a new variable called result.

Displaying the Result: Finally, it uses the print function to display the sum on the screen. It prints out "SUM =" followed by the calculated result.

When you run this code, you’ll see "SUM = 18" pop up in the console. It’s a simple yet effective way to show how to perform basic arithmetic in Python.
